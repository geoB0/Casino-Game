# Casino-Game

A casino program that uses a void function, if statements, and a random number generator. 
I am currently working on improving it. I know it can be much better but I'm proud of the outcome! 

I'm getting more confident with void functions and if statements but for some reason, I'm a little iffy on RNG. I'm working on it all to improve myself as a programmer.
